This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We use Prettier as an opinionated formatter accross the project.
This helps minimize diffs that might result from using different formatters.
If you use VSCode, you can just add this extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Environments
When building for a particular environment, we copy the corresponding environment file to .env.local, which has precedence over all other env files.
See [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#what-other-env-files-can-be-used) for more info.
Make sure not to add any secrets to the environment files, as they are accessible from the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run cypress open`

Launches the Cypress test runner, which we use for our E2E tests.


You will have to set the CYPRESS_password environment variable to the password used to log into flow.
If you are not using the email yash@betterfit.co, then set the CYPRESS_username env var as well.


Set the CYPRESS_BASE_URL env var to run the tests against a different url.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
